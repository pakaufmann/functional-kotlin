# Functional Kotlin with Arrow

This library tries to implement patterns and concepts of the [this repository](https://github.com/pakaufmann/ddd-to-the-code-workshop-sample-scala), 
but instead of Scala it uses Kotlin.

As Kotlin lacks concepts like higher-kinded types most of the code (even the domain-sepcific one),
is highly dependent on [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/).

# Disclaimer

Like the original project this implementation does not contain production-ready code.
